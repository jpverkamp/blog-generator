Static blog generator in the style of [Frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog).

This is currently a work in progress, although I hope to start using it for my own blog sooner rather than later. 

Dependencies (install with `raco pkg install`):
- at-exp-lib
- html
- html-parsing
- markdown
- srfi (recursively install a *lot* of packages)
- rackjure
- yaml
